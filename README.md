# Wanderwell

Wanderwell is a tool for exploring your spatial activities. The name is inspired
by [Aloha Wanderwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha_Wanderwell), a
Canadian explorer, author, filmmaker, and aviator.

This repository is the consolidation of a bunch of tools that I have written in
the past with similar intents.
